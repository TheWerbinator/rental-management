# Rental Management - A React Project
## Overview
This is the frontend for TheWerbinator's Senior React project 'Rental Management'.

The application is a barebones representation of a match-making service, much like Uber or AirBnb, that connects users wishing to rent heavy equipment with an inventory of equipment available to rent.

## Dependencies
This project is made to work in two parts - a frontend and a backend.

This repository is the frontend.
The backend lives at https://github.com/TheWerbinator/rental-management-backend

In addition to the backend, this project is also dependent on a number of packages that can be installed through Node Package Manager (NPM) by installing NPM and running the command 'npm i' in a terminal.

For information about the backend, including initial setup, please visit the backend repository page.
